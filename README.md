# NAVI
A Discord bot I made to use in small personal servers for managing roles and providing various utilities.

Current functionality includes: 

- Displaying server/user information
- Managing roles for members in order to access private channels
- League of Legends rank lookup and daily leaderboard
- Twitch-style predictions with points betting
- Bulk delete messages in a channel

with more functionality to come.
